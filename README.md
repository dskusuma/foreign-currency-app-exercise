# Foreign Exchange Currency Exercise
Author: I.B. Dwi Satria Kusuma

## Intro
This is created using my personal ReactJS Boilerplate, which use ReactJS as JS Framework, Storybook for Component Library / Development, and use TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for CSS.

The project structured in a such way so the components and the pages are in separated folder. The component development is isolated using Storybook. After I convinced that the components are good to go, then I use those components in the pages (in this case, there's only one page).

## Folder Structure
The projects will be stored in `src` folder which consist of

* `assets` folder:
  * `images` folder for storing images assets
* `components` folder, which consist of components. Each components have its own react component file, test file, style file (scss), and storybook file.
* `models` folder consist of files for firing api.
* `pages` folder consist of page files
* `routes` folder consist of routing file
* `utils` folder consist of utility function
